==== Rule
1. Wrapper class for only SERVICE LAYER
2. No wrapper class for MODEL LAYER

==== To do
[v] model           - abstraction of database structure
[ ] view            - abstraction of statically built pages
[ ] service         - usecases
[ ] repository      - domain features (maybe like, EventRepository.IsNewbie)
[ ] template        - template engine
[ ] util            - wrapping-layer of utility functions
[ ] MAIN            - main component

==== To decide
[ ] what template engine to use
[ ] what CSS framework to use
[ ] what JS framework to use
